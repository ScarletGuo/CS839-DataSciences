The widow of Duke <>Wen</> of Jin was a  daughter  of the  Qin ruling house,  and she spoke to her son regarding the three captive Qin generals, saying, "The hatred Duke <>Mu</> bears these men eats into his very bones  and  marrow! I beg you to send them back to Qin so that my  lord of Qin may  have the pleasure of boiling them alive!" The Jin ruler consented to this and sent the three generals back to Qin. When they arrived, Duke <>Mu</> donned white mourning garments and went   out to the suburbs to greet them.  Addressing  them,  he  wept  and  said,  "I failed to heed the advice of <>Baili Xi</> and <>Jian Shu</> and so brought shame on  you three. What fault have you committed? I ask only that you give all your thought to how we may wipe  out  this  disgrace,  never  slacking  your efforts!" He then restored the three men to their posts and ranks and  treated them with even greater  favour.
