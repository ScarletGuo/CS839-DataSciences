Qin also ordered <>Zheng Anping</>, <>Fan Ju</>¡¯s old benefactor from Wei, to carry out a strike against Zhao, but when <>Zheng Anping</> was surrounded by the Zhao forces and hard pressed, he surrendered to Zhao along with the 20,000 soldiers under his command. <>Fan Ju</>, the marquis of <>Ying</>, spread a mat of straw and asked to be punished for his crime. (According to Qin law, if a person whom one has recommended is guilty of a misdeed, the recommender suffers the same punishment as the perpetrator of the misdeed.) It was judged that the marquis of <>Ying</> should be punished by having his three sets of relatives taken into custody.
