Hoping to gain an interview with King <>Zhaoxiang</>, he sent someone to incite the marquis of <>Ying</> to anger by announcing, "<>Cai Ze</>, a visitor from Yan, is a man of extraordinary talent, one of the most eloquent and knowledgeable men in the world. If he once gains an interview with the king of Qin, the king is certain to make trouble for you and deprive you of your position!" When the marquis of <>Ying</> heard this, he said, "I already know all about the Five Emperors and the Three Dynasties of antiquity, and I can refute any amount of eloquence put forward by these talkers. How is this man going to make trouble for me and steal my position away?"
