Duke <>Xiang</> thus for the first time became the possessor of a feudal state and observed the rites appropriate to the exchange of  embassies  and  official visits and banquets. He used a set of three sacrificial animals, a red colt with a black mane, a yellow ox, and a ram, to sacrifice to the Lord on High at the Altar  of the  West.  In the  twelfth year  of his  rule, he  attacked the Rong and advanced as far as Mt. Qi, where he died. He was succeeded    by his son, Duke <>Wen</>.
