Sometime earlier, Duke <>Mu</> lost one of  his prize  horses. It  was discovered that a group of 300 or more rustics in the region of Mt. Qi had captured the horse and eaten it. The Qin officials in time apprehended the men and were about to punish them, but Duke <>Mu</> said, "A  gentleman does not allow his domestic animals to injure people.  I  have  heard that  if  one eats good horseflesh but fails to drink wine, it will lead to illness." He therefore had wine passed out to all the men and pardoned their offence. Later, when the 300 men heard that Qin was about to attack Jin, they all asked to join in the attack. They  were  thus among the  troops accompanying the duke, and when they saw him hard pressed, they all brandished their spears and fought to the death in order to repay the kindness he had shown them with regard to the horseflesh. Thus Duke <>Mu</> was able to take the ruler of Jin prisoner and return with him to Qin.
