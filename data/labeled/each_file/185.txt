Getting down on his knees and baring his arms, he asked the gatekeeper to convey his confession of guilt. <>Fan Ju</>, surrounded by curtains and with a host of attendants, received him in audience. <>Xu Jia</> bowed his head and acknowledged that he was deserving of death. "I had not imagined you could have risen so high above the blue clouds!" he said. "I will never again venture to read the world¡¯s books or comment on the world¡¯s affairs. I have committed a crime for which I deserve to be boiled alive, though with your permission I may perhaps be allowed to take myself far off to the lands of the Hu and Mo barbarians. My life and death are in your hands."
