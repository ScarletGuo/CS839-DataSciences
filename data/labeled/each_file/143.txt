"I have heard that one who is skilled at governing a country will make certain that his authority is firmly established within the state, and that his word is respected abroad. Yet the envoys of the marquis of <>Rang</> have usurped the king¡¯s authority, deciding on relations with the other feudal rulers, handing out fiefs to the world, attacking states, punishing opponents, and no one dares disobey them. If there is victory in battle, if the attacks succeed, then the benefits go to the marquis of <>Rang</>¡¯s fief in Tao and the losses are borne by the other feudal lords. And if the battles end in defeat, then it is the common people of Qin who are moved to anger, and it is Qin¡¯s altars of the soil and grain that will suffer misfortune in the end.
