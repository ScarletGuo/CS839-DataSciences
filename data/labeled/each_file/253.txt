At this time the burial of Duke <>Wen</> of Jin had not  yet  been carried out.  His heir, Duke <>Xiang</>, was enraged. "Qin thinks nothing of the fact that I am newly bereaved and takes advantage of our mourning to wipe  out  our  city of Hua!" he said. Then he dyed his  white  mourning  garments  black  and called out his troops to cut off the Qin forces at Yao. He inflicted a crushing defeat on the Qin army, not allowing a single man to escape. He took the three Qin commanders prisoner and returned with them to Jin.
