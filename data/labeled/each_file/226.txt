In Duke <>Mu</>'s twenty-third year Duke <>Hui</> of Jin died and his son <>Yu</>  was  set up as ruler. Duke <>Mu</> of Qin, angry at <>Yu</> for having escaped, thereupon invited the ducal son <>Chonger</> to come to Qin from the state of Chu, and offered him as a wife his daughter who had previously been married to <>Yu</>. <>Chonger</> at first declined the offer but later accepted her as his wife. Duke <>Mu</> treated him with increasing respect and   generosity.
