 The king of Qin wanted to put the prime minister <>Lv Buwei</> to death as well but, because he had won great distinction in the service of the former king, and because so many followers and men of eloquence came forward to speak on his behalf, the king could not bring himself to apply the death penalty. In the tenth month of the tenth year of his reign the king of Qin removed <>Lv Buwei</> from the office of prime minister.
