<>Zichu</> had been sent by the state of Qin to be a hostage at the court of Zhao,165 and since, in spite of this, Qin had several times invaded Zhao, the Zhao court accordingly treated <>Zichu</> with scant respect. Being merely a grandson of the king of Qin and the son of a concubine, and having been sent as hostage to one of the other feudal states, <>Zichu</> was poorly provided with carriages and other equipment and had to live in straightened circumstances, unable to do as he pleased.
