The Jin ruler, abandoning the main body of his troops, fought for the advantage with the Qin forces, but as he turned  his  carriage  around,  his horses became bogged down. Duke <>Mu</>  and  the  men  under  him  chased after in pursuit, but they were unable to capture the Jin ruler and instead found themselves surrounded by the Jin army. The Jin forces attacked Duke <>Mu</> and had wounded him when 300 men who had earlier eaten horse flesh at Mt. Qi raced to his rescue, braving the Jin forces. The Jin forces broke  their encirclement, so that Duke <>Mu</> was able to escape and return to his own forces, and in addition the Jin ruler was taken prisoner.
