"Now you have presented the Qin territory of Jiekou to Chu, and Chu has in turn enfeoffed you in Duyang with the title of a minor magistrate. But if Qin and Chu pool their forces to attack Hann again, then Hann is certain to be doomed. And if Hann is doomed, then <>Gongzhong Chi</> out of desperation will lead his own private forces in an assault on Qin. I hope you will give this careful thought!" <>Xiang Shou</> said, "In bringing Qin and Chu together as allies, I am not attempting to threaten Hann. Please tell <>Gongzhong Chi</> for me that Qin and Hann may also become allies."
