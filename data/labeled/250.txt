The two old men replied, "It is not that we would dare to detain your army. But when the army goes, our sons go with it. We are old, and if the army is long in returning, we fear we will never see them again. That is the only reason we weep." When the old men had withdrawn from the duke's presence, they said to their sons, "If the army you are with is defeated, it will surely be at the narrow defile of Yao." In the spring of Duke <>Mu</>â€˜sthirty-third year Qin's forces set out  for  the east. As they passed the northern gate of the Zhou capital on  their  way through Jin, the royal grandson Man said, "The Qin army has no sense of propriety. How could it help but suffer defeat?" The Qin troops had advanced as far as Hua when they encountered <>Xian Gao</>, a travelling merchant of Zheng who was taking twelve  oxen  to  the Zhou capital to sell. Seeing the Qin troops, he became fearful that he would  be put to death or  taken  captive,  and  so  he  presented  his  oxen,  saying, "The ruler of Zheng, hearing that  your  great state  was coming to punish  him, has respectfully taken measures for his defence, and at the same time has sent me with these twelve oxen for the provisioning of your officers." The three Qin generals conferred together, saying, "We had intended to make a surprise attack on Zheng, but now Zheng already knows about it. Better to abandon the mission than to go any farther." They proceeded to wipe out Hua, a city on the Jin border.
