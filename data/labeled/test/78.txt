Now <>Xiang Shou</> was guarding the city of Yiyang for Qin and preparing to attack Hann. <>Gongzhong Chi</> of Hann sent <>Su Dai</> to speak to <>Xiang Shou</>, saying, "An animal at bay may overturn a carriage. In the past you defeated Hann and inflicted shame on <>Gongzhong Chi</>. But <>Gongzhong Chi</> has persuaded his state to enlist once more on the side of Qin, because he believes that by doing so he will surely receive a fief from Qin.
