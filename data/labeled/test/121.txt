When Duke <>Ning</> died, the militia leaders Fuji, Weilei, and Sanfu deposed the heir apparent and set  up  <>Chuzi</>  as  ruler.  In  the  sixth  year  of  <>Chuzi</>'s rule, <>Sanfu</> and the others joined in arranging to have someone attack and  kill <>Chuzi</>. Thus <>Chuzi</> became ruler at the age of five and died in the sixth year of his rule. <>Sanfu</> and the  others then set up the  former  heir  apparent as ruler, who became Duke  <>Wu</>.
