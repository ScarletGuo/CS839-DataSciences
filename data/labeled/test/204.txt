<>Lv Buwei</> went to court and spoke to the First Emperor, saying, "The former minister <>Gan Mou</> has a grandson named <>Gan Luo</>. He is still only a boy, but since he is descended from a famous family, the other feudal rulers have all heard of him. Recently, <>Zhang Tang</> pleaded illness and was unwilling to go to Yan, but <>Gan Luo</> has persuaded him to make the journey. Now I would like to send the boy ahead to report this to Zhao and ask Zhao to permit him to pass through its territory."
