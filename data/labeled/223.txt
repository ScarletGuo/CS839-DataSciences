In  Duke  <>Mu</>'s  twenty-second  year  the  heir  apparent  Yu,  hearing  that  the Jin ruler  was ill, said to himself,  "Liang was my  mother's state, and now  Qin   has destroyed it. I have many brothers, and  if  my  father,  the  ruler  of  Jin, should pass away, Qin is certain to  detain me  here.  Then Jin will  ignore  my claim to the throne and set up one of my brothers  instead!"  He  therefore escaped from Qin  and  made  his  way  back  to Jin.
