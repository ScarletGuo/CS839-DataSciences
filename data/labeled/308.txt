<>Cai Ze</> said, "The present ruler in his concern for loyal ministers or the way he remembers old associates cannot compare to Duke Xiao, King <>Dao</>, or King Goujian of Yue. And in terms of merits and achievements or the trust, intimacy, and favour you enjoy with the ruler you cannot compare to Lord <>Shang</>, <>Wu Qi</>, or <>Dafu Zhong</>. And yet your position is one of great distinction, your emolument generous, and your private wealth surpasses that of those three gentlemen. And if you do not withdraw in time, I fear you may meet up with even worse troubles than they did. For your sake I cannot help feeling alarmed.
