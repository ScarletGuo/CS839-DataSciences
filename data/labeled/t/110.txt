"<>Wu Zixu</> hid himself in a sack and so escaped through the Zhao Pass, travelling by night, hiding by day, till he reached the Ling River, when he had not a morsel to put in his mouth.149 He crawled on his knees, inched over the ground, bowed his head, bared his arms, drummed on his stomach, and blew a flute, begging in the marketplace of Wu, yet in the end he raised Wu to greatness and made its ruler, King Hel¨¹, a hegemon. If I could offer all my counsels as did <>Wu Zixu</>, then although I might be condemned to prison for the remainder of my days and never again admitted into your presence, as long as my advice was put into practice, what sorrow would it be to me?
