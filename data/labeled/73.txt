<>Qin Zhong</> had five sons, the eldest of whom became Duke <>Zhuang</>. King Xuan summoned Duke <>Zhuang</> and his four brothers, gave them a force of 7,000 men, and sent  them  to  attack  the  Western  Rong,  whom  they defeated. The king then once more presented to Duke <>Zhuang</> the domain that had belonged to <>Qin Zhong</>, as well as the area of Dog Hill that had belonged to his ancestor <>Daluo</>, decreeing that he hold possession of both regions and act as grandee of the western border. Duke <>Zhuang</> resided in  the west, in the old region of Dog Hill.
