The Western Rong also revolted against the royal house and wiped out the descendants of <>Daluo</> in Dog Hill. When King <>Xuan</> came to the throne of Zhou, he made <>Qin  Zhong</>  a grandee and sent him to punish the Western Rong, but they killed him. <>Qin Zhong</> thus died among the Rong after holding his position for twenty-three years.
