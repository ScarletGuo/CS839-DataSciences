King <>Zhaoxiang</> said, "I would like very much to take over Hann. But suppose Hann will not listen ¡ª what will I do then?" <>Fan Ju</> replied, "Why would Hann fail to listen? If you send troops to attack <>Xingyang</>, then the road to Gong and Chenggao will be cut off. And in the north this will block the road to the Taihang Mountains, so the army stationed in Shangdang cannot come south. Thus by sending your troops out in a single attack on <>Xingyang</>, you can cut the state of Hann into three pieces. If Hann sees that it is faced with certain destruction, why would it fail to listen? And If Hann listens to you, then you can lay plans to become a hegemon."
