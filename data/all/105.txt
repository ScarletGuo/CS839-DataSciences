When <>Gan Mou</> had fled from Qin and was hurrying toward Qi, he met <>Su Dai</> along the way. <>Su Dai</> was going to Qin on a mission for the state of Qi. <>Gan Mou</> said, "I have become a criminal in the eyes of Qin and am running away in fear of the consequences, though I am afraid no place will have me. I have heard that a poor girl and a rich girl were once spinning thread together. The poor girl said, ‘I have no money to buy a torch, but your torch gives more than enough light and some to spare. Perhaps you can lend me a spare beam. It won't mean any less light for you, and it will be a big help to me!' Now I am in trouble, and you happen to be on your way to a mission in Qin. My wife and children are still in Qin. Perhaps you can help me out with some of your ‘spare beams'."
