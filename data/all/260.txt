<>Cai Ze</> was a native of the state of Yan. He travelled around to advance his studies and seek employment with the feudal rulers, visiting a number of states both large and small, but met with no success. He asked <>Tang Ju</> to examine his face and tell his fortune, saying, "I hear, Master, that you examined <>Li Dui</> and predicted that within 100 days he would take over the affairs of a state. Is that true?"
