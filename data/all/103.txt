In the first year of his rule, Duke <>Wen</> resided in  the  Western  Border Palace.  In his third year he took a force of 700 armed men and went east    to hunt. In his fourth year he arrived at the confluence of the <>Qian</> and Wei rivers. "In ancient times," he said, "the Zhou dynasty gave my ancestor <>Qin Ying</> this land to dwell in, and his descendants have at last succeeded in becoming feudal lords." He carried out divination by the  tortoise shell  to  see  if  he  should  settle  there.  The  answer  being favourable, he proceeded to build a town in which he took up residence.
