The guest minister <>Fan Ju</> spoke once more with King <>Zhaoxiang</>, saying: "The territories of Qin and Hann are interwoven like the strands of an embroidery. And Hann¡¯s existence is to Qin like a wood-borer to a tree, or a disease of the heart or belly to a man. As long as there is no drastic upset in the world, then it is all right. But if there should be some drastic upset, then no state will cause greater worry to Qin than Hann! Your Majesty would do best to take over Hann."
