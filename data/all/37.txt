Zhai Black Wolf sired <>Hengfu</> and <>Hengfu</> sired <>Zaofu</>.  Zaofu won favour  with King <>Mu</> of the  Zhou dynasty because  of his skill as a carriage driver.  King <>Mu</> acquired a team of four, made  up    of a  chestnut,  a  light  grey,  a  dappled red, and a  green ear,  and embarked on a hunting tour to the west, enjoying himself so much he forgot to return.
