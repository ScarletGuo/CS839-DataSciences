"The state of Chu measures several thousand square li in area and boasts a million lance bearers. Yet <>Bai Qi</>, leading an army of 30,000 or 40,000 engaged Chu in battle and in one battle captured Yan and <>Ying</> and put Yiling to the torch. And in a second battle he advanced south and annexed the regions of Shu and Han. In addition, he crossed through Hann and Wei and attacked the powerful state of Zhao, in the north defeating Lord <>Mafu</> and massacring his host of 40,000 or more, wiping them all out at Changping, till the blood flowed in rivers and the cries rose up like thunder. Then he pushed on to lay siege to Handan, so that Qin could aspire to the position of emperor. Chu and Zhao were the most powerful states in the world and Qin¡¯s chief enemies. But from this time on both Chu and Zhao bowed down in terror and did not venture to attack Qin ¡ª because of <>Bai Qi</>¡¯s exertions. In person he conquered over seventy cities, yet after he had accomplished these deeds, in the end he was presented with a sword and ordered to die at Duyou.
