"The reason Yan and Qin will not play false with one another is that they hope to attack Zhao and broaden their territories in the area between the Yellow and Zhang rivers. Your Majesty would do best to give me five cities so I can broaden Qin's territory in the area between the rivers. Then I will ask Qin to send Prince <>Dan</> back to Yan, and Qin can join with this powerful state of Zhao in attacking a weak Yan."
