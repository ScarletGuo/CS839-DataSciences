"The one who wields power in the state is called the king, the one who can dole out benefit or injury is called the king, the one who has the authority to kill or let live is called the king. Yet now the Queen Dowager wields authority without glancing in your direction, the marquis of Rang dispatches envoys without reporting to you on the matter, lords Huayang and Jingyang hand out penalties without compunction, and Lord Gaoling promotes and demotes men without asking leave. With four persons of such eminence, I have never heard of the state escaping peril. Where four persons of such eminence preside, one may say there is no king. How can the king's authority fail to be subverted? How can he hope to issue his own orders?
