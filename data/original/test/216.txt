 "This is a very good plan!" Su Dai replied. "Gan Mou would like to enlist the help of Wei in attacking Qi, while Gongsun Shi would like to enlist the help of Hann in attacking Qi. Now you will have gained merit by arranging a settlement in Yiyang, you will have brought both Chu and Hann over to the side of Qin, and with that assurance you may all three punish Qi and Wei for their faults. In that case Gongsun Shi and Gan Mou will be as powerless as ever."
