In his thirtieth year Duke Mu aided Duke Wen of  Jin  in  besieging  the  state of Zheng. Zheng sent an envoy to say to Duke Mu, "Destroying Zheng and increasing the power of Jin will benefit Jin,  but  hardly  be  to the  profit of Qin. The stronger Jin becomes the greater the worry for Qin!" Duke Mu thereupon called off his troops and returned to Qin, and Jin likewise abandoned the siege.
