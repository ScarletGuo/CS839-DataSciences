 When King Wu of Qin died and was succeeded by King Zhaoxiang, Shuli Zi was treated with even greater respect than before. In the first year of King Zhaoxiang (306 BC) Shuli Zi led an attack on the city of Pu. The defenders of Pu, fearful of the  outcome, requested Hu Yan to speak to Shuli Zi on Pu's behalf. Hu Yan said to Shuli Zi, "Are  you attacking Pu for the sake of Qin, or for the sake of Wei? If it is for the  sake of Wei, that is fine.  But if it is for  the  sake of Qin, then your efforts are misdirected. "The reason the state of Wey can continue to exist is because of Pu. Now if you attack Pu, it will turn for help to Wei, and if it does so, then Wey is certain to give in and follow suit. In the past Wei lost the territories it held west of the Yellow River to your state, and it has not been able to regain them because it is weak in military might. But now if Wey throws in its lot with Wei, then Wei will become strong. And the day Wei becomes strong,  your territories west of the Yellow River are bound to be threatened. Moreover, the king of Qin will be watching your every move, and if you injure Qin's interests to benefit Wei, he  is certain to call you to account!"
