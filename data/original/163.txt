Duke Mu untied his bonds and began questioning him on affairs of state. But  Baili Xi declined to answer,  saying,  "I am an official from a state that  has perished â€” how could I be worth consulting?"  Duke Mu said, "The ruler of Yu failed to make use of you and so he perished. That is no fault of yours." He persisted in his questioning, and they talked for three days. Duke Mu was overjoyed and wanted to hand over the governing of the state to him, entitling him Lord Five Ram Skins. But Baili Xi declined, saying, "I cannot compare to my friend Jian Shu. But no one in the world recognizes Jian Shu's worth. Once, when I was travelling and found myself in difficulty in the state of Qi, I had to beg food from the people of Zhi, and Jian Shu took me in. I wanted to use the opportunity to enter the service of Wuzhi, who was the ruler of Qi at that time, but Jian Shu dissuaded me, and so I was able to escape the difficulties that attended Wuzhi's downfall.
