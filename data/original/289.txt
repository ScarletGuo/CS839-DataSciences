In his thirty-sixth year Duke Mu once more bestowed favours  on Mengming and the other commanders and sent them to lead troops in an attack on Jin, burning their boats behind them when  they  crossed  the Yellow River. They inflicted a crushing defeat on the men of Jin, seizing the cities of Wangguan and Jiao and thus repaying Jin for the battle of Yao. The people of Jin all kept to their cities and did not venture  forth. Then Duke Mu in person crossed the Yellow River  at  Reed  Ford  and raised a grave mound for the dead who had fallen in the battle of Yao, proclaiming mourning and carrying out lamentations for three days. He then swore this oath with his army: "You, my officers and  men, hearken and cease your clamour! I declare this oath to you. The men of old consulted with their grey-haired ones, the  hoary-headed,  and  thus  they were without error. But I keep recalling how I failed to heed the counsels     of Jian Shu and Baili Xi.  Therefore I take this oath, so that ages hereafter  may remember my error."
