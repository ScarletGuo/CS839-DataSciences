 The First Emperor of Qin had sent Cai Ze, the lord of Gangcheng, as his envoy to the state of Yan, and three years later King Xi of Yan agreed to send his heir, Prince Dan, as a hostage to the state of Qin. Qin then ordered Zhang Tang to become prime minister of Yan, hoping that Yan would join Qin in an attack on Zhao so that it could broaden the territory under its control in the region between the Yellow River and the Zhang River.
