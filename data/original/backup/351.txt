 The Grand Historian remarks: Shuli Zi enjoyed high esteem because of his kinship with the ruler, and it was only natural that he should have done so. But the people of Qin recognized his wisdom and therefore took special note of his actions. Gan Mou rose up from the lanes and byways of Xiacai to gain prominence and fame among the feudal rulers, enjoying favour in the powerful states of Qi and Chu. Gan Luo was only a boy, but he devised one unusual scheme and his name is still mentioned in later ages. Though he was not what could be called a gentleman of sterling conduct, he deserves to be ranked with the strategists of the Warring States period. At that time, with Qin so powerful, the world was only too happy to resort to deceitful plots!
