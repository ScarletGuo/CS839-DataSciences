The forbears of the Qin were descendants of Emperor Zhuan Xu. Zhuan Xu's granddaughter was named Nvxiu.  When  Nvxiu  was  weaving,  a swallow happened to drop an egg. Nvxiu swallowed the egg and gave birth  to a son, Daye. Daye took as his wife a daughter of  Shao  Dian  named  Nvhua,  and Nvhua  gave  birth to Dafei.
