"When I took service under the ruler of Yu, Jian Shu once more tried to  stop me. I knew that the ruler of Yu would never heed me, but to tell the  truth, I was hoping to profit from the salary and rank and so I stayed on. If     I had once more listened to Jian Shu's advice, I would have escaped, but because I failed to do so, I was involved in the ruler's downfall. Because  of this I have come to understand his   worth." Duke Mu thereupon dispatched  an  envoy  with  generous  gifts  to  invite Jian Shu to take office, making him a grandee of the  upper rank.
