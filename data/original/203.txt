After Fan Ju had become prime minister, Wang Ji, the master of guests who first introduced him to the king, said to Fan Ju, "There are three things you can never know, and three things you can do nothing about once it is too late. When the ruler may pass away ¡ª that's the first thing you can never know. When you yourself may suddenly take leave of life ¡ª that's the second thing you can never know. And when I may suddenly end tumbled in a ditch ¡ª that's the third thing you can never know. Once the ruler has passed away, then it will be too late to regret what you might have done for me. Once you yourself have suddenly taken leave, then it will be too late for such regrets. And once I have suddenly ended tumbled in a ditch, then it will be too late!"
