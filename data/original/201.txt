 Su Dai replied, "Ah, but I would like to tell you something. People say that the eminent are accorded eminence because there is something about them that merits eminence. In terms of affection and intimacy, you are not as close to the king of Qin as Gongsun Shi, and in terms of wisdom and ability, you are no match for Gan Mou. But neither of these two men is allowed to play a vital role in the affairs of Qin, while you alone join with the king in deciding upon matters of state. Why? Because there is some fault that attaches to these two. Gongsun Shi is in the party that favours Hann, and Gan Mou is in the party that favours Wei. Therefore the king does not trust them.
