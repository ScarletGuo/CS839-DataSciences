Moving closer, Fan Ju said, "The marquis of Rang hopes to cross through Hann and Wei and attack the city of Gangshou in Qi, but this is not good planning. If he sets out with too small a force, he will not have strength enough to inflict damage on Qi. And if he calls out too large a one, he will do harm to Qin. I believe Your Majesty's plan is to send out a small force and then have Hann and Wei call out all their troops, but that is hardly fair to them. And just because Qi, an allied state, chooses to be unfriendly, can you cross through someone else's state to attack it? This is bad planning indeed!
