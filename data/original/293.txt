Cai Ze said, " When the sovereign is a sage and his ministers are worthy, that is the greatest good fortune for the world as a whole. When the ruler is clear-sighted and his ministers are honest, that is the good fortune of the state. When fathers are loving and sons filial, husbands trustworthy and wives faithful, that is the good fortune of the family. "Nevertheless, though Bi Gan was loyal, he could not save the Yin dynasty, though Wu Zixu was wise, he could not preserve the state of Wu, and though Prince Shensheng was filial, his country of Jin was beset by disorder. These states all possessed loyal ministers and filial sons, yet they encountered disorder and downfall. Why? Because there was no clear- sighted ruler or worthy father to heed the ministers and sons. Therefore the world heaps censure and shame on the rulers and fathers and pities the ministers and sons. Similarly, Lord Shang, Wu Qi, and Dafu Zhong carried out their role as ministers correctly, but the rulers they served were at fault. Therefore the world praises these three as men who achieved merit but failed to receive reward. But it surely doesn't wish to imitate their unfortunate deaths!
