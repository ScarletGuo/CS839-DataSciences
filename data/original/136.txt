Duke Wu had only one son, named Bai. Bai was not  set up as ruler  but  was enfeoffed in Pingyang. Instead, Duke  Wu's  younger  brother  became ruler and is known as Duke De. In the first year of his rule Duke De took up  residence  in the  Dazheng Palace in the city of Yong. He used 300  sets  of  sacrificial  animals  to  sacrifice at the Altar of Fu. Divining by the tortoise shell to see if he should reside at Yong, he was told that his sons  and  grandsons  in  ages  to  come would water their horses at the Yellow River. The earls of Liang and Rui came to pay their respects at the Qin court.
