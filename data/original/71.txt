"Words that are truly pertinent I would not venture to entrust to a letter. And those that are shallow would not be worth the heeding. I wonder if it is because I am stupid that I have failed to stir Your Majesty's heart? Or could it be because the person who recommended me is unworthy that I am not employed? If it is neither, then may I beg to be granted a moment when Your Majesty is not engaged in outings and excursions so I may gaze afar on your countenance? If at that time I utter one word that is ineffectual, may I be condemned to the axe!" King Zhaoxiang was very pleased with the letter and, apologizing to Wang Ji, sent a relay carriage to fetch Fan Ju. So Fan Ju was granted an interview at the detached palace. Pretending not to know his way around, Fan Ju wandered into the passageway leading to the inner palace. When the king arrived, the eunuchs in charge angrily pushed him out of the passageway, saying, "The King is coming!"
