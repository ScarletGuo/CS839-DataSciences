King Zhaoxiang then sent a letter to the king of the state of Zhao, saying, "Your younger brother is here in Qin, and Wei Qi, the enemy of our Lord Fan, is at the home of Lord Pingyuan in Zhao. You had better send someone to bring Wei Qi's head here as quickly as possible. Otherwise I will call out my troops and attack Zhao, and I will also see to it that your younger brother does not get out of the Hangu Pass!"
