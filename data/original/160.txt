Baili Xi escaped from Qin and fled to Wan, where he was  seized  by  villagers of the state of Chu. Duke Mu had heard that Baili Xi was a man of worth and was anxious to buy him back from his captors, but he was afraid that the people of Chu would not hand him over. He therefore sent a messenger to say to Chu, "Baili Xi, one of the  attendants  to  my  bride, is there with you. I am prepared to offer five black ram skins as ransom for him." The people of Chu agreed to this and handed him over.  At this time Baili Xi was over seventy years old.
