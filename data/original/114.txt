 Lao Ai, fearful that calamity was about to befall him, plotted with the members of his clique and, using the queen dowager's seal of authority without her permission, called out troops and initiated a revolt in the Qinian Palace. The king dispatched officers to attack Lao Ai's forces and Lao Ai fled in defeat. He was pursued and cut down at Haozhi, and eventually his whole clan was wiped out. This marked the beginning of Lv Buwei's fall from power. What Confucius said about the "man of fame" might well apply to this Master Lv, might it not?
