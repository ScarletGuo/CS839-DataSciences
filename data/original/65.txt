The marquis of Rang and Lord Huayang were younger brothers of King Zhaoxiang's mother, Queen Dowager Xuan, while Lord Jingyang and Lord Gaoling were both younger brothers of King Zhaoxiang by the same mother. The marquis of Rang served as prime minister, while the other three men took turns serving as military leader. All were enfeoffed with cities, and because of their kinship with the Queen Dowager, their private wealth exceeded that of the ruling house. Later, when the marquis of Rang became military leader of Qin, he hoped to cross through the states of Hann and Wei and attack the Qi city of Gangshou so that he could broaden his fief in Tao.
