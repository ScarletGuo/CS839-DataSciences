 Shuli Zi's house was situated west of the mortuary temple of King Zhaoxiang, in the village of Shuli Zi or the Gentleman of Shuli. Later, when the Han dynasty arose, the Palace of Lasting Joy was situated to the east of his grave and the Eternal Palace to  the west, while the arsenal was directly in front of it. The people of Qin used to say: "For strength, Ren Bi; for wisdom, Shuli."
