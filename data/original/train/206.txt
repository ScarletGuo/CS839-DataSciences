Fan Ju, troubled by these words, went in and spoke to the king, saying, "If it had not been for Wang Ji's loyalty to the state, no one would have allowed me to enter the Hangu Pass. And if it had not been for Your Majesty's sageliness and worth, no one would have thought of elevating me to high office. Now I have advanced to the post of prime minister and am ranked among the marquises, yet Wang Ji's office is still that of master of guests. This is surely not what he expected when he first allowed me to enter Qin!"
