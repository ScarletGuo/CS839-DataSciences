"Now among the holders of noble rank and the higher level ministers, as well as among Your Majesty's personal attendants, there are none who are not the marquis of Rang's men. When I see Your Majesty standing all alone in court, I cannot help fearing that, after your years of life are ended, those who rule the state of Qin will not be Your Majesty's descendants!" King Zhaoxiang, thoroughly alarmed at these words, said, "You are quite right!" He then demoted the Queen Dowager and obliged the marquis of Rang and lords Gaoling, Huayang, and Jingyang to leave the capital and go beyond the Pass. He honoured Fan Ju with the post of prime minister, relieving the marquis of Rang of the seals of office and sending him to his fief in Tao. The government was ordered to supply wagons and oxen for the move, and a train of over 1,000 vehicles arrived at the Pass. The officials at the Pass, examining the contents, found that the precious vessels and other rare and unusual objects exceeded those in the possession of the royal house.
