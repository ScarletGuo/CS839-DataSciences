Zhang Tang spoke to Lv Buwei, the marquis of Wenxin, about this, saying, "In the past I was ordered by King Zhaoxiang of Qin to carry out an attack on Zhao. The Zhao ministers in their wrath announced that â€˜Anyone who seizes Zhang Tang gets a 100 li tract of land!' Now if I go to Yan, I will invariably have to pass through Zhao. I am afraid I cannot undertake such a journey."
