 In the third year of his rule King Wu said to Gan Mou, "I want to send my war chariots through the region of the three rivers and call on the Zhou royal house. Then though I die my name will never perish." Gan Mou said, "If I may have permission to go to Wei, I will get Wei to promise to join us in an attack on Hann." The king instructed Xiang Shou to accompany Gan Mou to Wei.
