Lv Buwei had selected from among the ladies of Handan one of matchless beauty and great skill in dancing and had lived with her, and in time he learned that she was pregnant. Zichu, joining Lv Buwei in a drinking bout, happened to catch sight of her and was pleased. Immediately he stood up, proposed a toast to Lv's long life, and asked if he might have her. Lv Buwei was outraged, but soon recalled that he had by now invested all of his family's wealth in Zichu in hopes of fishing up some wonderful prize, and so in the end he presented the woman to him. She concealed the fact that she was pregnant, and when her time was up, she bore a son who was named Zheng. Zichu eventually made her his consort.
