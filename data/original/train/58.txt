Because of his parentage Zhongjue paid allegiance to the Zhou dynasty and guarded the western border for it. As  a  result,  there  was  peace and harmony on the western border. Now I have given my daughter to Daluo as a wife and she has borne him a son, Cheng, who has been designated heir.  The Shen and Daluo families are thus doubly related, and   all the Western Rong people have submitted to you. That is  why  you are  able to reign as king. Your Majesty would do well to consider this."
