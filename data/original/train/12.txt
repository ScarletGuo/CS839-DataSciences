The king of Chu, angered by this, berated the Zhou king for according Qin's representative such high honour. But You Teng, a visitor from another state, spoke to the king of Chu on Zhou's behalf, saying, "When Zhi Bo attacked the state of Jiuyou, he first sent in broad  wagons  and  then  followed them up with troops, and so Jiuyou was destroyed. Why? Because it was not on its guard. When Duke Huan of Qi attacked the state of Cai, he said, ‘I'm punishing Chu!' but in fact he pounced on Cai.  Now Qin,  a country  of tigers and wolves, has sent Shuli Zi with an entourage of 100 carriages to visit the Zhou capital. But Zhou recalls the fate of Jiuyou and Cai.  Therefore it has long lances going before him, and strong crossbows  bringing up the rear. In name it is  ‘guarding  him',  but  in fact  it  has  made him its prisoner.  How could Zhou fail to be concerned for its altars of the soil and grain? Indeed, if it should one morning go out of  existence,  that would be a worry even to Your Majesty!" With this the king of Chu's anger gave way to delight.
