In Duke Mu's twelfth year, Guan Zhong and Xi Peng of Qi died. The state of Jin, being afflicted with drought, came to Qin to request grain. Pi Bao advised Duke Mu not to give Jin any grain but instead to take advantage of the famine to launch an attack on it. Duke Mu asked Gongsun Zhi for his opinion. He replied, "Years of dearth and plenty simply go in a cycle. You cannot refuse the  request." And when the  duke  questioned Baili Xi, he said, "Yiwu has acted wrongly toward you, but what wrong have his people done?" So in the end the  duke  heeded  the  advice  of  Gongsun  Zhi and Baili Xi and sent grain to Jin, transporting it in boats and carts that stretched in a continuous line all the way from the  Qin capital  at  Yong  to  the Jin capital at Jiang.
