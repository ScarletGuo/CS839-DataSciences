Duke Xiang led his  troops  to  escort  King  Ping  to  the  new  capital.  King Ping enfeoffed Duke Xiang as one  of the  feudal  lords,  bestowing on him the land from Mt. Qi on west. "The Rong  have behaved  in  an  unprincipled  manner,  invading  and  seizing  our  lands  of  Qi  and  Feng,"  he  said.  "But  Qin has succeeded in attacking and driving out the Rong, and therefore he shall possess these lands." Thus the king  swore an oath with  Duke  Xiang, bestowing a  fief  and title  on  him.
