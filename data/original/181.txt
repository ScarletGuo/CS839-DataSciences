Yiwu said, "If I succeed in becoming ruler, I would like  to  take  eight  of Jin's cities lying west of the Yellow River and present them to Qin." Once he had reached Jin and become ruler, however, he sent Pi Zheng to Qin with excuses, reneging on his promise and failing to hand over the cities west of the Yellow River. Moreover, he put Li Ke to death.
