At this time King Zhaoxiang was already in his thirty-sixth year of rule (271 BC). In the south his forces had captured the Chu cities of Yan and Ying, and King Huai of Chu had died in confinement in Qin. In the east Qin had inflicted a defeat on Qi, and though King Min of Qi had for a time taken the title of emperor, he later abandoned it. Qin had also several times made trouble for the Three Jin, the states of Hann, Wei, and Zhao. But the king was weary of "men of great eloquence" and put no faith in them.
