Fan Ju replied, "Court it with humble phrases and rich gifts. If that does not work, bribe it with territorial concessions. And if that does not work, call out your troops and attack it!" The king said, "I will honour your instructions." He appointed Fan Ju a "guest minister" for the planning of military affairs. Heeding Fan Ju's advice, he dispatched the fifth rank counsellor Wan to attack Wei, where he captured Huai. Two years later he captured Xingqiu.
