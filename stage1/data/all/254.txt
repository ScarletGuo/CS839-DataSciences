King <>Zhaoxiang</> said, "I hear that the iron swords of Chu are sharp and its entertainers are clumsy. If its iron swords are sharp, then its fighting men will be valorous, and if its entertainers are clumsy, then the ruler will turn his thoughts to distant campaigns. And if the ruler begins to think of distant campaigns and has valorous men at his command, I fear that Chu may have designs on Qin! "Unless one stores up articles ahead of time, he will have no way to meet sudden needs. Now Lord <>Wuan</> is already dead and <>Zheng Anping</> and his men have turned against me. I have no good generals here at home, but many enemy states abroad. That is what causes me worry!"
