"If one must die first before he can prove his loyalty or establish his name, then <>Wei Zi</> was no model of benevolence, Confucius was unworthy to be called a sage, or <>Guan Zhong</> to be called great. When a man sets out to achieve merit, surely he hopes that he will be able to preserve his life at the same time, does he not? If he can preserve both life and name, that is the finest. If he leaves behind a model name but loses his life in the process, that is the next best. But if his name is heaped with censure and shame, while his life continues, that is the lowest of all." The marquis of <>Ying</> indicated his approval.
