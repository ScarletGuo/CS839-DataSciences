But he seated <>Xu Jia</> in the lower part of the hall, had chopped hay and beans placed before him, and stationed two tattooed criminals on either side to force him to eat in horse fashion. Then he berated him, saying, "Tell the king of Wei this for me ¡ª he had better bring me the head of <>Wei Qi</> at once! If not, I¡¯ll massacre every person in the Wei apital of Daliang!"
