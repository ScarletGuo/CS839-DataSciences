When <>Fan Ju</> had been prime minister of Qin for two years, in the forty- second year of King <>Zhaoxiang</>¡¯s reign (265 BC), Qin advanced east, attacking the Hann cities of Shaoqu and Gaoping and capturing them. King <>Zhaoxiang</> of Qin, hearing that <>Fan Ju</>¡¯s old enemy <>Wei Qi</> was at the home of Lord <>Pingyuan</>, wanted to help <>Fan Ju</> carry out his revenge. So, feigning a friendly tone, he wrote a letter to Lord <>Pingyuan</>, saying, "I have heard of your high ideals and would like very much to associate with you on terms of simple friendship. If you will be good enough to visit me, I wish to spend ten days drinking with you."
