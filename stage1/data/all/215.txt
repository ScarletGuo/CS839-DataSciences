Lord <>Pingyuan</> was fearful of Qin and, accepting the letter at face value, journeyed to Qin to visit King <>Zhaoxiang</>. After he and King <>Zhaoxiang</> had drunk together for several days, the king said, "Long ago, when King <>Wen</> of the Zhou acquired the services of <>Lv Shang</>, he addressed him as Grand Duke, and when Duke Huan of Qi acquired <>Guan Zhong</>, he addressed him as Uncle. Now Lord Fan is in like manner an Uncle to me. Lord Fan¡¯s enemy is staying at your home. I would like you to send someone to go and fetch his head. If not, I will not permit you to leave the Pass."
