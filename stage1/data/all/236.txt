Lord <>Xinling</>, much chagrined, sent a carriage to the outskirts of the city to fetch the two men. But when <>Wei Qi</> learned that Lord <>Xinling</> had at first objected to granting him an interview, he was so angry that he cut his own throat. The king of Zhao, receiving word of this, was thus able in the end to turn over <>Wei Qi</>¡¯s head to Qin. King <>Zhaoxiang</> of Qin then permitted Lord <>Pingyuan</> to return to Zhao.
