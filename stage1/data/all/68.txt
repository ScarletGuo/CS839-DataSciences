At this point <>Fan Ju</> submitted a letter to the king which said: "I have heard that when an enlightened ruler conducts his government, persons of merit never fail to receive reward, and persons of ability never fail to receive office. Those whose achievements are great receive generous emolument, those whose merits are many are awarded noble rank, and those who can govern the masses are given high office. Hence persons who lack ability do not dare accept assignment, while those who have ability are not allowed to remain in the shade. Therefore if you think my words worth heeding, please permit me to put them into practice and so bring increase and benefit to your regime. And if you think them not worth heeding, then it is pointless to detain me here any longer. "The saying has it that the mediocre ruler rewards those he loves and punishes those he hates. But the enlightened ruler is not like this. His rewards go only to those with merit, and his penalties go only to those judged guilty of crime. Now although I may not even be worth the trouble it takes to haul me before the executioner¡¯s block or subject me to the blow of the axe, I would hardly venture to take up Your Majesty¡¯s time with mere nonsense. And although you might dismiss me as a worthless person, one lightly to be scorned, you would surely think it a grave matter to suspect the one who recommended me of playing false with you, would you not? "I have heard that Zhou has its Zhiai, Song its Jielu, Liang its Xuanli, and Chu its Hepu. These four precious jewels were produced by the earth but at first were overlooked even by expert craftsmen, though they have since become objects renowned throughout the world. Is it not possible, then, that among the persons cast aside by the sage ruler there are those who can enrich the state?
