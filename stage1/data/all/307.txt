<>Zhao Dun</>, a high official of Jin, wanted to make him ruler of Jin and therefore dispatched Sui Hui to go to Qin to fetch him. The Qin armed forces had escorted <>Yong as</> far as <>Linghu</> when the people of Jin, having meanwhile set up Duke <>Xiang</>'s son as their new ruler, instead sent a force to attack the Qin army. The Qin army was defeated and Sui Hui fled back to Qin.
