The internal secretary Liao replied,  "This  Rong ruler  lives  hidden away  in the borderlands and has never heard the music of China. You could try sending him some women musicians to distract  his  attention.  Meanwhile you could make various requests of You Yu in order to cause dissension between him and his ruler, detaining him here and failing to send him back when the date for his return comes. The Rong ruler will wonder at this and will surely begin to suspect You Yu. Once dissension is sown between ruler and subject, we can make  You  Yu  our  captive.  And if the  Rong ruler  likes our music, he is bound to neglect affairs of government."
