Still wrapped in the reed mat, Fan Ju said to the man guarding him, "If you can get me out of this, I'll see that you are generously rewarded." The guard accordingly asked to be allowed to dispose of the body in the mat. Wei Qi, drunk at the time, gave permission, and thus Fan Ju was able to escape. Later Wei Qi regretted his action and sent people to look for Fan Ju. But a man of Wei named Zheng Anping, hearing what had happened, spirited Fan Ju into hiding and kept him concealed, changing Fan Ju's name to Zhang Lu.
