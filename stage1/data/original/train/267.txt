Now you have twenty or more brothers, and from the point of view of age, you are about halfway down the line. You enjoy no particular favour and have been a hostage at the court of one of the other feudal lords for a long time. If your grandfather, the old king, should pass away and Lord Anguo become king, I'm afraid you would have little chance of competing for the position of crown prince with your elder brothers or with your other brothers who are there in person morning and evening to wait upon your father."
