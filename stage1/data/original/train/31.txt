Feilian at this time had been sent by Zhou on a mission to the northern region. When he returned, he had no one to report to, so he built an altar on Mt. Huotai and there made his report. He found a stone coffin with an inscription that read: "The emperor orders you, Chufu, not to take part in Yin's disorders, but presents you with a stone coffin to bring glory to your family."  When Feilian died, he was accordingly buried on Mt. Huotai.
