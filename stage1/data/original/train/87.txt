"But now, when Qin and Chu are vying for power, if you ally yourself with the party that favours Chu, then you will be travelling the same road as Gongsun Shi and Gan Mou. How will you be any different from them? "People all say that Chu is expert at shifting sides. And if it should do so, then you will have to flee the state. And you will have brought it on yourself. It would be better, therefore, to consult with the king of Qin so as to anticipate such shifts. If you prepare against Chu's inconstancy by befriending Hann, you can avoid difficulty. Hann first of all follows the advice of Gongsun Shi in matters of state, and as a next step entrusts itself to Gan Mou. In trusting these men in this way, it is in a sense your enemy. Therefore, when you recommend that Qin guard against Chu's inconstancy by befriending Hann, it will appear that in foreign affairs you do not hesitate to recommend an enemy."
