Long ago, when the philosopher Zeng Can was living in Bi, an inhabitant of Lu who had the same surname and given name as Zeng Can killed a man. Someone came to Zeng Can's mother and said, ‘Zeng Can killed a man!' but his mother went on weaving just as before. After a while someone else came and said, ‘Zeng Can killed a man!' but still his mother went on with her weaving. After a while, however, when a third person came and said, ‘Zeng Can killed a man!', his mother dropped her shuttle, scrambled down from the loom, climbed over the wall and ran away. Worthy as Zeng Can was, and as much as his mother trusted him, when three people cast suspicion on him, even his mother became frightened.
