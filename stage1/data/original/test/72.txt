King Zhaoxiang, however, had just become ruler, and since his mother was a woman of Chu, he did not dare go to Hann's assistance. Gongzhong Chi then requested Gan Mou to speak on Hann's behalf to the king of Qin. Gan Mou addressed King Zhaoxiang in these words: "Gongzhong Chi at present believes that Qin will come to the rescue of Hann, and therefore he ventures to hold out against Chu. But now, although Hann's city of Yongshi is besieged, Qin's troops do not advance beyond the Yao Pass. If Gongzhong Chi is thus placed in a difficult position, he will no longer be able to face the Hann court. And then his rival, Gongshu, may decide that Hann should face south and throw in its lot with Chu. In that case Chu and Hann will become allies, and Wei will not dare do otherwise than follow suit. Then the circumstances will be ripe for a concerted attack on Qin. Which is better, to sit by and wait for others to attack, or to take the initiative in attacking others?"
