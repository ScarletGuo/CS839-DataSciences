When Pi Zheng received word of this, he was frightened and began scheming with Duke Mu, saying,  "The  people  of  Jin  do  not  want  Yiwu  as their ruler. The one they really want is Chonger. This going against  the promise to Qin and putting Li Ke to death is all a plot by Lv Sheng and Xi Rui . I advise you to offer some inducement and send an urgent summons  to Lv and Xi. Once they are here, it will  be  easy  to  have  Chonger  made ruler  of Jin."
