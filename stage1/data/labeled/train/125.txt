"In the past King <>Min</> of Qi marched south to attack Chu, defeating its army, killing its leader, and expanding Qi's territory by 1,000 li. But Qi in the end could not retain possession of an inch of that land, not because it did not want the land, but because the circumstances would not permit it. For when the other feudal rulers saw that Qi's troops were exhausted and that ruler and subject were at loggerheads, they called out their own men and attacked Qi, infliciting a defeat. Its officers suffered shame, its soldiers bowed down, and all blamed the king, saying, 'Who made this plan?' The king said, '<>Tian Wen</> made it!' and the great ministers thereupon revolted and drove <>Tian Wen</> from the state. Thus Qi's great defeat came about because in attacking Chu it played into the hands of Hann and Wei. This is what is called lending arms to bandits and providing rations to thieves.
