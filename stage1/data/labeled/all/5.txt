<>Boyi</>, the ancestor of Qin, assisted Emperor <>Yu</>.  Duke <>Mu</>, mindful   of righteousness, mourned for those who fought at Yao; but when they used men to accompany him in death,  the poem  on  the "Yellow Birds" was sung. King <>Xiaoxiang</> opened the way for an emperor. Thus I made "The Basic Annals of Qin"

The forbears of the Qin were descendants of Emperor <>Zhuan Xu</>. <>Zhuan Xu</>'s granddaughter was named <>Nvxiu</>.  When  <>Nvxiu</>  was  weaving,  a swallow happened to drop an egg. Nvxiu swallowed the egg and gave birth  to a son, <>Daye</>. <>Daye</> took as his wife a daughter of  <>Shao  Dian</>  named  Nvhua,  and Nvhua  gave  birth to <>Dafei</>.

<>Dafei</> joined the sage ruler <>Yu</> in pacifying the waters and the land, and when the work had been completed, Emperor <>Shun</> presented <>Yu</> with a black jade baton. When <>Yu</> accepted it, he said, "I could not have done this if <>Dafei</> had not acted as my helper."

Emperor <>Shun</> said, "Ah, <>Fei</>! You assisted  <>Yu</>  in  his  task.  You  shall  be given a black banner. Your descendants will hereafter prosper greatly." He also gave him as a wife a beautiful daughter of the <>Yao  clan</>.

<>Dafei</>, bowing and accepting these gifts, aided <>Shun</> in subduing and  training the birds and beasts, and many of the birds and beasts became submissive. This was the man known as <>Boyi</>. Shun bestowed on him the surname <>Ying</>.

<>Dafei</> had two sons. One was called <>Dalian</> and was the founder of the Bird-custom family. The other  was called <>Ruomu</>  and was the  founder  of the Fei family. His great-great-grandson  was  <>Fei  Chang</>. Some of  <>Fei Chang</>'s descendants lived in China and some lived among  the  <>Yi</>  and  <>Di</> tribes.

In the time  of  <>Jie</>,  the  last  ruler  of  the  Xia  dynasty,  <>Fei Chang</>  deserted the Xia dynasty and went over to the side of the Shang.  King <>Tang</>, founder    of the Shang, made him his carriage driver  when  he defeated  <>Jie</>  at Mingtiao.

Dalian's great-great-grandsons were <>Mengxi</>  and  <>Zhongyan</>. <>Zhongyan</> had the body of a bird but spoke like a human being. Emperor  <>Taiwu</>, hearing of him, divined to see if he should  employ  him  as  his  carriage driver. The response being favourable, he employed him as such, and also gave   him   a  wife.  

 From  the   time  of  Emperor   <>Taiwu</>  on,   the   heirs of <>Zhongyan</> won merit generation after generation by assisting the state of Shang. Hence many members of the Ying family gained prominence and in time  became feudal lords.

<>Zhongyan</>'s great-great-grandson was <>Zhongjue</>. He lived among the Western Rong people and guarded the western border. <>Zhongjue</> sired <>Feilian</>, and <>Feilian</> sired <>Elai</>. <>Elai</> was very strong and <>Feilian</> was skilled    at running; both father and son offered their strength and ability in the service of Zhou, the  last ruler  of the Shang or Yin dynasty.  When King <>Wu</> of the Zhou dynasty attacked and killed Zhou of the Yin,  <>Elai</> was killed at  the same time.

<>Feilian</> at this time had been sent by Zhou on a mission to the northern region. When he returned, he had no one to report to, so he built an altar on Mt. Huotai and there made his report. He found a stone coffin with an inscription that read: "The emperor orders you, Chufu, not to take part in Yin's disorders, but presents you with a stone coffin to bring glory to your family."  When <>Feilian</> died, he was accordingly buried on Mt. Huotai.

<>Feilian</> had another son named <>Jisheng</>, and <>Jisheng</> had a son named <>Mengzeng</>. <>Mengzeng</> enjoyed favour with King <>Cheng</> of the Zhou dynasty and is known as Zhai Black Wolf. 

Zhai Black Wolf sired <>Hengfu</> and <>Hengfu</> sired <>Zaofu</>.  Zaofu won favour  with King <>Mu</> of the  Zhou dynasty because  of his skill as a carriage driver.  King <>Mu</> acquired a team of four, made  up    of a  chestnut,  a  light  grey,  a  dappled red, and a  green ear,  and embarked on a hunting tour to the west, enjoying himself so much he forgot to return. 

When the rebellion of King <>Yan</> of Xu broke out, <>Zaofu</> was acting as  carriage driver for King <>Mu</> and he raced over the long road back  to  the Zhou capital, covering 1,000 li in one day, in order to put down  the rebellion.

King <>Mu</> enfeoffed <>Zaofu</> in the city of Zhao, and  <>Zaofu</>'s  kin  from this  time on were known by the surname Zhao. It was five generations from <>Feilian</> and his son <>Jisheng</> down to <>Zaofu</>. <>Zaofu</> lived away from the  court  in Zhao;  <>Zhao Cui</> was his  descendant. 

<>Feilian</>'s son <>Elai</> or <>Ge</> died  at an  early age.  He  had  a son  named <>Nvfang</>,  who sired <>Panggao</>.  <>Panggao</>  sired   <>Taiji</>,   <>Taiji</>   sired   <>Daluo</>,   and <>Daluo</>  sired <>Feizi</>.  Because of the favour  enjoyed  by <>Zaofu</>,  all   these persons  were  permitted  to  be  counted  as  members  of  the  Zhao  family  of the  city  of Zhao.

<>Feizi</> lived at Quanqiu or Dog Hill. He loved horses and domestic animals and was skilled at raising and breeding them. The people of Dog Hill mentioned him to King Xiao of the Zhou dynasty, and King <>Xiao</> summoned him and ordered him to pasture the royal horses in the area between the Qian and Wei rivers. The horses increased greatly in number.


King <>Xiao</> wanted to see <>Feizi</> designated as the heir  of  <>Daluo</>.  But  Marquis <>Shen</> had given his daughter to <>Daluo</> as a wife and she had borne him a son named <>Cheng</> who had been designated as  heir.  

Marquis  <>Shen</>  said to King <>Xiao</>, "Long ago an ancestor of mine, a woman  of  Mt.  <>Li</>,  married a man of the Rong people named <>Xuxuan</> and bore a son named <>Zhongjue</>. 

Because of his parentage <>Zhongjue</> paid allegiance to the Zhou dynasty and guarded the western border for it. As  a  result,  there  was  peace and harmony on the western border. Now I have given my daughter to Daluo</> as a wife and she has borne him a son, Cheng</>, who has been designated heir.  The Shen and Daluo</> families are thus doubly related, and   all the Western Rong people have submitted to you. That is  why  you are  able to reign as king. Your Majesty would do well to consider this."

King Xiao</> replied, "Long ago Boyi</> supervised the raising of animals for Emperor Shun</>, and the animals multiplied greatly.  Therefore  he was assigned a domain and presented with the surname <>Ying</>. 

Now  his descendant in later  ages  is  raising horses  for  me.  I  therefore  propose  to set aside land  for  him  so  he  may  become  a  dependant  domain,  assigning him the town of Qin and instructing him to carry on sacrifices to the Ying family." He gave <>Feizi</> the title Qin Ying and refrained  from  removing  <>Daluo</>'s son by the daughter of Marquis Shen from the position of heir in order to remain at peace with the Western  Rong.

<>Qin Ying<> sired <>Qin Hou</>, who died after ten years of rule. <>Qin Hou</> sired <>Gongbo</>, who died after three years of rule. <>Gongbo</> sired Qin  Zhong. Three years after <>Qin Zhong</> assumed power, King <>Li</> of the Zhou dynasty acted in an unprincipled manner and many of the feudal lords turned against him. 

The Western Rong also revolted against the royal house and wiped out the descendants of <>Daluo</> in Dog Hill. When King <>Xuan</> came to the throne of Zhou, he made <>Qin  Zhong</>  a grandee and sent him to punish the Western Rong, but they killed him. <>Qin Zhong</> thus died among the Rong after holding his position for twenty-three years.


<>Qin Zhong</> had five sons, the eldest of whom became Duke <>Zhuang</>. King Xuan summoned Duke <>Zhuang</> and his four brothers, gave them a force of 7,000 men, and sent  them  to  attack  the  Western  Rong,  whom  they defeated. The king then once more presented to Duke <>Zhuang</> the domain that had belonged to <>Qin Zhong</>, as well as the area of Dog Hill that had belonged to his ancestor <>Daluo</>, decreeing that he hold possession of both regions and act as grandee of the western border. Duke <>Zhuang</> resided in  the west, in the old region of Dog Hill.

Duke <>Zhuang</> had three sons, of whom the eldest was named <>Shifu</>. <>Shifu</> said,  "The  Rong killed our  grandfather  <>Qin Zhong</>.  Until  I  have  killed the
ruler of the Rong, I will not  venture  to enter  my  domain."  He accordingly led his forces in a surprise attack on the Rong, turning over his domain to   his younger brother, Duke <>Xiang</>. Duke <>Xiang</> thus became  the  heir  apparent.

After Duke <>Zhuang</> had ruled for forty-four years he died and the heir apparent, Duke <>Xiang</>, succeeded him as ruler.

In the first year of his rule, Duke  <>Xiang</> gave  his  younger  sister,  <>Muying</>,  to be the wife of King <>Feng</>.

In the second year of Duke <>Xiang</>'s reign the Rong besieged <>Shifu</> at Dog Hill. <>Shifu</>attacked them but was taken prisoner.  A year or so later <>Shifu</>  was returned to his domain.

In the spring of Duke <>Xiang<>/'s seventh year, King <>You</> of the Zhou dynasty, heeding the wishes of his favourite, <>Baosi</>, removed the heir  apparent  and set up <>Baosi</>'s son in his place, and several times deceived the feudal lords. 

The feudal lords revolted against him, and the Western Rong and Dog Rong peoples, joining forces with Marquis <>Shen</>, attacked the Zhou capital  and killed King You at the foot of Mt. <>Li</>. Duke <>Xiang</> of Qin led his forces to the rescue of the Zhou, fighting bravely in battle and winning merit. In order to avoid harassment from the Dog Rong, the Zhou dynasty moved its capital  east to the city of Luoyang.

Duke <>Xiang</> led his  troops  to  escort  King  <>Ping</>  to  the  new  capital.  King <>Ping</> enfeoffed Duke <>Xiang</> as one  of the  feudal  lords,  bestowing on him the land from Mt. <>Qi</> on west. "The Rong  have behaved  in  an  unprincipled  manner,  invading  and  seizing  our  lands  of  <>Qi</>  and  <>Feng</>,"  he  said.  "But  Qin has succeeded in attacking and driving out the Rong, and therefore he shall possess these lands." Thus the king  swore an oath with  Duke  <>Xiang</>, bestowing a  fief  and title  on  him.

Duke <>Xiang</> thus for the first time became the possessor of a feudal state and observed the rites appropriate to the exchange of  embassies  and  official visits and banquets. He used a set of three sacrificial animals, a red colt with a black mane, a yellow ox, and a ram, to sacrifice to the Lord on High at the Altar  of the  West.  In the  twelfth year  of his  rule, he  attacked the Rong and advanced as far as Mt. Qi, where he died. He was succeeded    by his son, Duke <>Wen</>.
In the first year of his rule, Duke <>Wen</> resided in  the  Western  Border Palace.  In his third year he took a force of 700 armed men and went east    to hunt. In his fourth year he arrived at the confluence of the <>Qian</> and Wei rivers. "In ancient times," he said, "the Zhou dynasty gave my ancestor <>Qin Ying</> this land to dwell in, and his descendants have at last succeeded in becoming feudal lords." He carried out divination by the  tortoise shell  to  see  if  he  should  settle  there.  The  answer  being favourable, he proceeded to build a town in which he took up residence.

In his tenth year he established the Altar of Fu, using a set of three sacrificial animals in the rites there. In his thirteenth year the  historians  for the first time began to keep a record of events, and many of the inhabitants changed their ways. In his sixteenth year Duke <>Wen</> led his forces in an attack on the Rong, who fled in defeat. Duke <>Wen</> thereupon gained possession of the land as far as Mt. Qi, where the remnants of the Zhou people lived. He presented the area east of Mt. Qi to the Zhou dynasty. In his nineteenth year he gained possession of the Treasures of Chen.

In his twentieth year the law stipulating that a criminal's three sets of relatives should be put to death along with the criminal himself was first promulgated. In his twenty-seventh year he attacked Daxin, Feng, and Date in the Southern Mountains. In his forty-eighth year Duke <>Wen</>'s heir apparent died and was given the posthumous title of Duke <>Jing</>. Duke <>Jing</>'s eldest son, the grandson of Duke <>Wen</>, was designated heir apparent.
In his fiftieth year of rule Duke <>Wen</> died and was buried on the Western Mountain. Duke <>Jing</>'s son was set up as ruler and is known as Duke <>Ning</>.

In his  second year  of rule  Duke  <>Ning</> moved his  residence  to  Pingyang. He dispatched troops to attack Dangshe. In his third year he fought  with  <>Hao</>, the ruler of Dangshe, and <>Hao</> fled to the Rong people. Thus the settlement at Dangshe was wiped out. In his fourth year <>Hui</>, a ducal son of the state of Lu, assassinated his lord, Duke <>Yin</>. In his twelfth year Duke <>Ning</> attacked the Dang family and took them  prisoner. Duke  <>Ning</> became ruler in his tenth year and died in his twelfth year of rule, being buried on the Western Mountain.

Duke <>Ning</> had three sons,  of whom the  eldest,  who  became  Duke  <>Wu</>, had been designated heir apparent. The second son, who had  the  same mother as the first, became Duke <>De</>. The third, Chuzi,  was  the  son of  a woman from the ruling family of the state of Lu.

When Duke <>Ning</> died, the militia leaders Fuji, Weilei, and Sanfu deposed the heir apparent and set  up  <>Chuzi</>  as  ruler.  In  the  sixth  year  of  <>Chuzi</>'s rule, <>Sanfu</> and the others joined in arranging to have someone attack and  kill <>Chuzi</>. Thus <>Chuzi</> became ruler at the age of five and died in the sixth year of his rule. <>Sanfu</> and the  others then set up the  former  heir  apparent as ruler, who became Duke  <>Wu</>.

In the first year of his rule Duke <>Wu</> attacked Pengxi, advancing as far  as Mt. Hua. He took up residence in the Feng Palace in Pingyang. In his third  year he punished <>Sanfu</> and the others, wiping them out along with their three sets of relatives.  This was because  they had killed <>Chuzi</>.  <>Gao Qumi</>  of the  state of Zheng killed his  lord, Duke  <>Zhao</>  (695 BC).  

In his  tenth  yearDuke <>Wu</> attacked the Rong people of <>Gui</> and <>Ji</> and for the first time established a district (xian) in the area. In his eleventh year he set up the districts of Du and Zheng and wiped out the  settlement of   <>Xiaoguo</>.

In Duke  <>Wu</>'s  thirteenth year  <>Guan Zhifu</>,  <>Lian Cheng</> and other  men of  Qi killed their lord, Duke <>Xiang</>, and set up the ducal grandson <>Wuzhi</> as ruler.  The state of Jin wiped out the  states of Huo, Wei, and Geng.  <>Yong Lin</> of Qi killed <>Wuzhi</>, <>Guan Zhifu</>, and the others and set up Duke  <>Huan</> of  Qi.  

Jin and Qi thus became powerful states. In Duke <>Wu</>'s nineteenth year   the ruler of <>Quwo</>in Jin for the  first time  assumed the  title  of marquis  of  Jin. Duke <>Huan</> of Qi became an overlord (ba) at Juan. Duke <>Wu</> of Qin died in his twentieth year of rule and was buried at Pingyang in Yong.  For  the  first time there were persons to accompany him in death, in this case sixty-six persons.

Duke <>Wu</> had only one son, named <>Bai</>. <>Bai</> was not  set up as ruler  but  was enfeoffed in Pingyang. Instead, Duke  <>Wu</>'s  younger  brother  became ruler and is known as Duke <>De</>. In the first year of his rule Duke <>De</> took up  residence  in the  Dazheng Palace in the city of Yong. He used 300  sets  of  sacrificial  animals  to  sacrifice at the Altar of Fu. Divining by the tortoise shell to see if he should reside at Yong, he was told that his sons  and  grandsons  in  ages  to  come would water their horses at the Yellow River. The earls of Liang and Rui came to pay their respects at the Qin court.

In  the  second  year  of  Duke  <>De</>'s  rule  the  fu was  observed  for  the first
time, dogs being used to suppress evil influences. Duke <>De</> became ruler at the age of thirty-three and died after two years of rule. He had three sons; the eldest became Duke <>Xuan</>,  the  second  became Duke  <>Cheng</>, and the  youngest  became Duke  <>Mu</>.

After the death of Duke <>Wu</>, his eldest son became ruler and is known as Duke <>Xuan</>. In the first year of Duke <>Xuan</>'s rule the states of Wey and Yan attacked the Zhou court, drove out King <>Hui</>, and set up Prince <>Tui</> as ruler. In Duke <>Xuan</>'s third year the earl of <>Zheng</> and Shu of <>Guo</> killed Prince <>Tui</> and put King <>Hui</> back on the throne.

In the fourth year of his rule Duke <>Xuan</> set up  the  Mi Altar.  He fought  with the state of Jin at Heyang and was victorious. In his twelfth year Duke <>Xuan</> died. He had nine sons but none of them became ruler. Instead Duke <>Xuan</>'s younger brother was set up and is known as Duke <>Cheng</>.

In the first year of Duke Cheng's rule the  earls of <>Liang</> and <>Rui</> came  to  the Qin Court. Duke <>Huan</>  of  Qi  attacked  the  Mountain  Rong  and encamped at Guzhu. Duke Cheng died in the fourth year of his rule. He had seven sons but none of these became ruler, the  rule  passing  to  Duke  <>Cheng</>'s  younger  brother, who  became Duke <>Mu</>.

In the first year of Duke <>Mu</> (659 BC), whose personal name was <>Renhao</>, the duke led an attack on Maojin and defeated it. In his fourth year he took a bride from the state of Jin; she was an elder sister of <>Shensheng</>, the heir apparent of Jin. This year Duke <>Huan</> of Qi attacked the state of Chu, advancing as far as Shaoling.

In Duke <>Mu</>'s fifth year, Duke <>Xian</> of Jin wiped out the  states of Yu  and  Guo and took prisoner the ruler of Yu  and the  grandee  <>Baili Xi</>.  He did this by bribing the men of Yu with jade disks and horses. After taking <>Baili Xi</> prisoner, he sent him to Qin to act as  an  attendant  to  Duke  <>Mu</>'s  bride. 

<>Baili Xi</> escaped from Qin and fled to Wan, where he was  seized  by  villagers of the state of Chu. Duke <>Mu</> had heard that <>Baili Xi</> was a man of worth and was anxious to buy him back from his captors, but he was afraid that the people of Chu would not hand him over. He therefore sent a messenger to say to Chu, "<>Baili Xi</>, one of the  attendants  to  my  bride, is there with you. I am prepared to offer five black ram skins as ransom for him." The people of Chu agreed to this and handed him over.  At this time Baili Xi was over seventy years old.

Duke <>Mu</> untied his bonds and began questioning him on affairs of state. But  <>Baili Xi</> declined to answer,  saying,  "I am an official from a state that  has perished — how could I be worth consulting?"  Duke <>Mu</> said, "The ruler of Yu failed to make use of you and so he perished. That is no fault of yours." He persisted in his questioning, and they talked for three days. Duke <>Mu</> was overjoyed and wanted to hand over the governing of the state to him, entitling him Lord Five Ram Skins. But <>Baili Xi</> declined, saying, "I cannot compare to my friend <>Jian Shu</>. But no one in the world recognizes <>Jian Shu</>'s worth. Once, when I was travelling and found myself in difficulty in the state of Qi, I had to beg food from the people of Zhi, and <>Jian Shu</> took me in. I wanted to use the opportunity to enter the service of <>Wuzhi</>, who was the ruler of Qi at that time, but <>Jian Shu</> dissuaded me, and so I was able to escape the difficulties that attended <>Wuzhi</>'s downfall.

"Later I went to the Zhou capital. Prince <>Tui</> of Zhou liked cattle, and so I tried to gain his attention by my skill in raising cattle. But when Prince <>Tui</> tried to employ me, <>Jian Shu</> stopped me from accepting. So I left, and was thus able to avoid being wiped out along with Prince <>Tui</>'s other supporters.

"When I took service under the ruler of Yu, <>Jian Shu</> once more tried to  stop me. I knew that the ruler of Yu would never heed me, but to tell the  truth, I was hoping to profit from the salary and rank and so I stayed on. If     I had once more listened to <>Jian Shu</>'s advice, I would have escaped, but because I failed to do so, I was involved in the ruler's downfall. Because  of this I have come to understand his   worth." Duke <>Mu</> thereupon dispatched  an  envoy  with  generous  gifts  to  invite <>Jian Shu</> to take office, making him a grandee of the  upper rank.

In the autumn of this year Duke <>Mu</> led his troops in an attack on Jin, fighting with the  Jin forces at Hequ.  Lady <>Li</> fomented trouble in Jin, and as  a result the heir apparent <>Shensheng</> killed himself at New  City  and  <>Chonger</>  and <>Yiwu</> fled to Ben.

In the ninth year of Duke <>Mu</>'s rule, Duke  <>Huan</> of  Qi  called the  other feudal lords together for a meeting at Sunflower Hill. Duke <>Xian</> of Jin died, whereupon Lady <>Li</> set up her son <>Xiqi</> as ruler of Jin. <>Li Ke<>, a Jin official,  killed <>Xiqi</>, and when <>Xun Xi</> set up another of the duke's sons, Zhuozi, as ruler, <>Li Ke<>  killed him too, along with <>Xun Xi</>.  

<>Yiwu</> then sent  an envoy to Qin asking if Qin would help him to become ruler of Jin. Duke <>Mu</> agreed to this and ordered <>Baili Xi</> to lead a force of troops and escort <>Yiwu</> to Jin.

<>Yiwu</> said, "If I succeed in becoming ruler, I would like  to  take  eight  of Jin's cities lying west of the Yellow River and present them to Qin." Once he had reached Jin and become ruler, however, he sent <>Pi Zheng<> to Qin with excuses, reneging on his promise and failing to hand over the cities west of the Yellow River. Moreover, he put <>Li Ke<> to death.

When <>Pi Zheng<> received word of this, he was frightened and began scheming with Duke <>Mu</>, saying,  "The  people  of  Jin  do  not  want  <>Yiwu</>  as their ruler. The one they really want is <>Chonger</>. This going against  the promise to Qin and putting <>Li Ke<> to death is all a plot by <>Lv Sheng</> and <>Xi Rui</> . I advise you to offer some inducement and send an urgent summons  to <>Lv</> and <>Xi</>. Once they are here, it will  be  easy  to  have  <>Chonger</>  made ruler  of Jin."

Duke <>Mu</> agreed to this and sent someone to return with <>Pi Zheng<> to Jin and invite <>Lv Sheng</> and <>Xi Rui</>  to come to Qin. These two men, suspecting that <>Pi Zheng<> was acting in collusion with Qin, advised <>Yiwu</> to  have  <>Pi  Zheng</> put to death. <>Pi Zheng<>'s son <>Pi Bao</> fled  to  Qin,  where  he  advised Duke <>Mu</>, saying, "The ruler of Jin is unprincipled and his  people  do  not support him. He is ripe for attack!"

But Duke <>Mu</> said, "If the people do not support him, then how is he able to put  to death a chief minister  such as <>Pi Zheng<>. The fact that he  can do  so shows that he and his people are in accord." So he  refused to heed <>Pi Bao</>'s advice, though he secretly made use of him.

In Duke <>Mu</>'s twelfth year, <>Guan Zhong</> and <>Xi Peng</> of Qi died. The state of Jin, being afflicted with drought, came to Qin to request grain. <>Pi Bao</> advised Duke <>Mu</> not to give Jin any grain but instead to take advantage of the famine to launch an attack on it. Duke <>Mu</> asked <>Gongsun Zhi</> for his opinion. He replied, "Years of dearth and plenty simply go in a cycle. You cannot refuse the  request." And when the  duke  questioned <>Baili Xi</>, he said, "<>Yiwu</> has acted wrongly toward you, but what wrong have his people done?" So in the end the  duke  heeded  the  advice  of  <>Gongsun  Zhi</> and <>Baili Xi</> and sent grain to Jin, transporting it in boats and carts that stretched in a continuous line all the way from the  Qin capital  at  Yong  to  the Jin capital at Jiang.

In Duke <>Mu</>'s fourteenth year there was a famine  in Qin  and  the  duke sent a request to Jin for grain.  The  ruler  of  Jin  consulted  his chief ministers. <>Guo Shi</> said. "Take advantage of the famine and attack Qin.  You  can win great merit!" The Jin ruler decided to follow this advice.
In Duke <>Mu</>‘sfourteenth year the ruler of  Jin called out  his  troops  and  led them in an attack on Qin. Duke <>Mu</> dispatched his own  troops,  appointing <>Pi Bao</> to lead them, and he himself took part in the attack.  On  the day renxu of the ninth month, he joined in battle with <>Yiwu</>, Duke <>Hui</> of Jin, in the region of Han.

The Jin ruler, abandoning the main body of his troops, fought for the advantage with the Qin forces, but as he turned  his  carriage  around,  his horses became bogged down. Duke <>Mu</>  and  the  men  under  him  chased after in pursuit, but they were unable to capture the Jin ruler and instead found themselves surrounded by the Jin army. The Jin forces attacked Duke <>Mu</> and had wounded him when 300 men who had earlier eaten horse flesh at Mt. Qi raced to his rescue, braving the Jin forces. The Jin forces broke  their encirclement, so that Duke <>Mu</> was able to escape and return to his own forces, and in addition the Jin ruler was taken prisoner.

Sometime earlier, Duke <>Mu</> lost one of  his prize  horses. It  was discovered that a group of 300 or more rustics in the region of Mt. Qi had captured the horse and eaten it. The Qin officials in time apprehended the men and were about to punish them, but Duke <>Mu</> said, "A  gentleman does not allow his domestic animals to injure people.  I  have  heard that  if  one eats good horseflesh but fails to drink wine, it will lead to illness." He therefore had wine passed out to all the men and pardoned their offence. Later, when the 300 men heard that Qin was about to attack Jin, they all asked to join in the attack. They  were  thus among the  troops accompanying the duke, and when they saw him hard pressed, they all brandished their spears and fought to the death in order to repay the kindness he had shown them with regard to the horseflesh. Thus Duke <>Mu</> was able to take the ruler of Jin prisoner and return with him to Qin.

He circulated an order throughout the  state,  saying, "Fast  until tomorrow. I am going to offer the Jin ruler  as  a  sacrifice  to  the  Lord on High." When the Zhou Son of Heaven heard of this, he exclaimed,  "Jin  belongs to the same clan as myself!" and begged Duke <>Mu</> to spare the    Jin ruler.

Duke <>Mu</>'s wife was an older sister of <>Yiwu</>, the Jin ruler, and when she heard of the proposed sacrifice, she donned mourning garments and appeared barefoot before the duke, saying, "I was unable to instruct my younger brother properly and so have occasioned you this inconvenience."

Duke <>Mu</> said, "I supposed it was an illustrious feat to have captured the  Jin ruler. But now the Son of Heaven speaks on his behalf, and my wife is grieved." He therefore swore an  oath  of  alliance  with  the  Jin  ruler  and gave him permission to return to his own state, shifting him to better quarters and feasting him with seven sets of sacrificial animals.

In the eleventh month the Jin ruler <>Yiwu</> returned to his state. He presented Qin with the territory west of the Yellow River and sent the heir apparent Yu to be a hostage in Qin.  Duke <>Mu</> gave the heir  apparent Yu one  of his daughters for a wife. At this time, therefore, the  Qin  territory  extended all the way east to the Yellow River.

In Duke <>Mu</>'s eighteenth year,  Duke  <>Huan</>  of  Qi  died.  In  his  twentieth year Qin wiped out the states of Liang and Rui.

In  Duke  <>Mu</>'s  twenty-second  year  the  heir  apparent  Yu,  hearing  that  the Jin ruler  was ill, said to himself,  "Liang was my  mother's state, and now  Qin   has destroyed it. I have many brothers, and  if  my  father,  the  ruler  of  Jin, should pass away, Qin is certain to  detain me  here.  Then Jin will  ignore  my claim to the throne and set up one of my brothers  instead!"  He  therefore escaped from Qin  and  made  his  way  back  to Jin.

In Duke <>Mu</>'s twenty-third year Duke <>Hui</> of Jin died and his son <>Yu</>  was  set up as ruler. Duke <>Mu</> of Qin, angry at <>Yu</> for having escaped, thereupon invited the ducal son <>Chonger</> to come to Qin from the state of Chu, and offered him as a wife his daughter who had previously been married to <>Yu</>. <>Chonger</> at first declined the offer but later accepted her as his wife. Duke <>Mu</> treated him with increasing respect and   generosity.

In Duke <>Mu</>‘stwenty-fourth year he sent an envoy to inform the high ministers of Jin that he wished to place <>Chonger</> on the throne of Jin; the ministers of Jin gave their consent. Duke <>Mu</>  accordingly  sent  men  to  escort <>Chonger</>  to Jin,  and in the  second month he  was set up as ruler  of  Jin. He is known as Duke <>Wen</>. Duke <>Wen</> then dispatched men to kill <>Yu</>.  <>Yu</>  is known posthumously as Duke<> Huai </>of Jin.
In the autumn of this year Dai, the younger brother of King <>Xiang</> of the Zhou dynasty, led the Di people in an attack on the king. The king fled from the capital and took up residence in the state of Zheng. In the twenty-fifth year of <>Duke <>Mu</></> the Zhou king sent envoys to Jin and Qin to inform them of his difficulties. Duke <>Mu</> of Qin led his troops and assisted Duke <>Wen</> of Jin   in restoring the Zhou king to his throne and killing his younger brother Dai.

In Duke <>Mu</>‘stwenty-eighth year Duke <>Wen</> of Jin defeated the state of  Chu at Chengpu.

In his thirtieth year Duke <>Mu</> aided Duke <>Wen</> of  Jin  in  besieging  the  state of Zheng. Zheng sent an envoy to say to Duke <>Mu</>, "Destroying Zheng and increasing the power of Jin will benefit Jin,  but  hardly  be  to the  profit of Qin. The stronger Jin becomes the greater the worry for Qin!" Duke <>Mu</> thereupon called off his troops and returned to Qin, and Jin likewise abandoned the siege.

In Duke <>Mu</>‘sthirty-second year Duke <>Wen</> of Jin died (628  BC).  Some men of Zheng offered to  betray  Zheng  to  Jin,  saying,  "We  have  charge  of the  city gate  — Zheng can be taken by surprise   attack."

Duke <>Mu</> consulted <>Jian Shu</> and <>Baili Xi</>, but they replied, "No one  who  has to pass through numerous states and journey 1,000 li to carry out a surprise attack is likely to have much success. Moreover,  if  these  men betray Zheng's secrets to us, how do we know that people of our own state are not secretly informing Zheng of our plans? The idea is impossible!"

But Duke <>Mu</> replied, "You understand nothing  of  this.  I  have  already made my decision!" Then he called out his forces, appointing <>Baili Xi</>'s son <>Mengming Shi</>, <>Jian Shu</>'s  son <>Xiqi  Shu</>,  and <>Bai Yibing</> to  lead the  troops. The day the troops set out, <>Baili Xi</> and <>Jian Shu</> both wept over the departure. Duke <>Mu</> accosted them angrily, saying,  "Now  that  my  troops are setting out, what do you mean by weeping and trying to detain the army?"

The two old men replied, "It is not that we would dare to detain your army. But when the army goes, our sons go with it. We are old, and if the army is long in returning, we fear we will never see them again. That is the only reason we weep." When the old men had withdrawn from the duke's presence, they said to their sons, "If the army you are with is defeated, it will surely be at the narrow defile of Yao." In the spring of Duke <>Mu</>‘sthirty-third year Qin's forces set out  for  the east. As they passed the northern gate of the Zhou capital on  their  way through Jin, the royal grandson Man said, "The Qin army has no sense of propriety. How could it help but suffer defeat?" The Qin troops had advanced as far as Hua when they encountered <>Xian Gao</>, a travelling merchant of Zheng who was taking twelve  oxen  to  the Zhou capital to sell. Seeing the Qin troops, he became fearful that he would  be put to death or  taken  captive,  and  so  he  presented  his  oxen,  saying, "The ruler of Zheng, hearing that  your  great state  was coming to punish  him, has respectfully taken measures for his defence, and at the same time has sent me with these twelve oxen for the provisioning of your officers." The three Qin generals conferred together, saying, "We had intended to make a surprise attack on Zheng, but now Zheng already knows about it. Better to abandon the mission than to go any farther." They proceeded to wipe out Hua, a city on the Jin border.

At this time the burial of Duke <>Wen</> of Jin had not  yet  been carried out.  His heir, Duke <>Xiang</>, was enraged. "Qin thinks nothing of the fact that I am newly bereaved and takes advantage of our mourning to wipe  out  our  city of Hua!" he said. Then he dyed his  white  mourning  garments  black  and called out his troops to cut off the Qin forces at Yao. He inflicted a crushing defeat on the Qin army, not allowing a single man to escape. He took the three Qin commanders prisoner and returned with them to Jin.

The widow of Duke <>Wen</> of Jin was a  daughter  of the  Qin ruling house,  and she spoke to her son regarding the three captive Qin generals, saying, "The hatred Duke <>Mu</> bears these men eats into his very bones  and  marrow! I beg you to send them back to Qin so that my  lord of Qin may  have the pleasure of boiling them alive!" The Jin ruler consented to this and sent the three generals back to Qin. When they arrived, Duke <>Mu</> donned white mourning garments and went   out to the suburbs to greet them.  Addressing  them,  he  wept  and  said,  "I failed to heed the advice of <>Baili Xi</> and <>Jian Shu</> and so brought shame on  you three. What fault have you committed? I ask only that you give all your thought to how we may wipe  out  this  disgrace,  never  slacking  your efforts!" He then restored the three men to their posts and ranks and  treated them with even greater  favour.

In Duke <>Mu</>‘sthirty-fourth year  Shangchen,  the  heir  apparent  of  the state of Chu, murdered his father, <>King Cheng</>, and became  ruler  in  his place. Duke <>Mu</> once more ordered <>Mengming Shi</> and  the  other commanders to lead the Qin forces in an attack on Jin. They engaged in  battle at Pengya but, failing to win  the  advantage,  withdrew  their  troops and returned home.

The ruler of the Rong people sent <>You Yu</> to Qin. <>You Yu</>'s forbears were people of Jin who had fled from Jin and gone to live among the Rong. <>You Yu</> could therefore speak the language of Jin. The  Rong  ruler,  having  heard  that Duke <>Mu</> was a worthy man, dispatched <>You Yu</> to observe  the  situation in Qin.

Duke <>Mu</> showed <>You Yu</> the goods and possessions heaped up in his palace, but <>You Yu</> said, "If these were made by ghosts, it must have  exhausted the spirit world, and if they were made by human beings, it must have been bitter for the people!"

Duke <>Mu</>, puzzled, questioned him, saying, "China employs the Odes and Documents, its rites and music, its laws and regulations to govern the land, but even so there are times of chaos. Now  the  Rong and Yi people  have  none of these, so how can they bring about order? It must be very difficult,  is it not?"

<>You Yu</> laughed and replied, "It is precisely because of these that China is in chaos! In ancient times when the  sage  rulers  such  as  the  Yellow Emperor created rites and music, laws and regulations, they took the lead in observing and carrying them out, and a small measure of order was achieved. But the rulers of later ages grow daily more arrogant and licentious, scrutinizing and berating their subjects in the name of the law, while their subjects, utterly exhausted, angrily reproach their superiors in  the name of benevolence and righteousness. So superior  and  inferior wrangle and revile one another, usurping and murdering until whole clans are wiped out. And all because of such things as rites and music, laws and regulations!
"The Rong and Yi people are not like this. Superiors treat their inferiors with simplicity and thoughtfulness, while  inferiors  serve  their  superiors with loyalty and good faith, and the governing of the whole state is like the ordering of a single individual. No one knows why  order  comes  about  — such is the ordering of a true sage." When Duke <>Mu</> retired from the interview, he questioned his internal secretary Liao, saying, "I have heard that  a  sage  in  a  neighbouring  state can be a source of worry to that state's rivals. Now this worthy man <>You Yu</> could be a threat to me.  What should I do?"

The internal secretary <>Liao</> replied,  "This  Rong ruler  lives  hidden away  in the borderlands and has never heard the music of China. You could try sending him some women musicians to distract  his  attention.  Meanwhile you could make various requests of <>You Yu</> in order to cause dissension between him and his ruler, detaining him here and failing to send him back when the date for his return comes. The Rong ruler will wonder at this and will surely begin to suspect <>You Yu</>. Once dissension is sown between ruler and subject, we can make  <>You  Yu</>  our  captive.  And if the  Rong ruler  likes our music, he is bound to neglect affairs of government."

Duke <>Mu</> approved this plan and accordingly seated <>You Yu</>  on  a  mat  close by his side, pressed one dish after another  on him,  and  questioned  him about the topography of the Rong territory and the strength of  its  armed forces, till he had learned all about them. Then he ordered the internal secretary to send two sets of eight women musicians each to the Rong ruler. The Rong ruler accepted the musicians,  found  them  to  his  liking, and by year-end had still not sent them back. Qin then sent <>You Yu</> back to his own country.

<>You</>   Yu    repeatedly   admonished   the   Rong   ruler,   but   his  advice   went
unheeded. Meanwhile, Duke <>Mu</> several times sent persons to speak to <>You Yu</> in secret and invite him to come to Qin. In the end <>You Yu</> left the Rong ruler and came over to the side of Qin. Duke <>Mu</> treated him with the courtesy due a guest and questioned him on how to go about attacking the Rong.

In his thirty-sixth year Duke <>Mu</> once more bestowed favours  on Mengming and the other commanders and sent them to lead troops in an attack on Jin, burning their boats behind them when  they  crossed  the Yellow River. They inflicted a crushing defeat on the men of Jin, seizing the cities of Wangguan and Jiao and thus repaying Jin for the battle of Yao. The people of Jin all kept to their cities and did not venture  forth. Then Duke <>Mu</> in person crossed the Yellow River  at  Reed  Ford  and raised a grave mound for the dead who had fallen in the battle of Yao, proclaiming mourning and carrying out lamentations for three days. He then swore this oath with his army: "You, my officers and  men, hearken and cease your clamour! I declare this oath to you. The men of old consulted with their grey-haired ones, the  hoary-headed,  and  thus  they were without error. But I keep recalling how I failed to heed the counsels     of <>Jian Shu</> and </>Baili Xi</>.  Therefore I take this oath, so that ages hereafter  may remember my error."

When gentlemen heard of this, they all wept tears of admiration, saying, "Ah, Duke <>Mu</> of Qin did right by others. So in the end  he  achieved  a felicitous  outcome  through Mengming."
In his thirty-seventh year Duke <>Mu</> employed <>You Yu</>'s advice to carry out an attack on the Rong ruler, acquiring twelve new states, extending his territory 1,000 li, and making himself overlord of the Western Rong. The Son of Heaven dispatched Guo, the Duke of Shao, to congratulate Duke <>Mu</> and present him with a golden drum.

In his thirty-ninth year (621 BC) Duke <>Mu</> died and was buried at  Yong. He was accompanied in death by 177 persons. Three good ministers of the </>Ziyu</> family, <>Yanxi</>, <>Zhonghang</> and <>Zhenhu</>, were among those who followed him in death. The people  of  Qin,  grieved  at  this,  composed  for  them  the song in the Book of Odes known as "Yellow Birds".

The gentleman remarks: Duke <>Mu</> of Qin broadened his territory and increased his state, in the east humbling the powerful Jin, in  the  west making himself overlord of the Rong barbarians. But he never became a leader of the alliance, which is only right. For when he died, he cast aside  his people and instead enlisted his good ministers to  accompany  him  in death. When the kings of antiquity passed away, they left  virtue  behind  them and laws to be handed down. How could they ever snatch away their best men and good ministers, causing their people to grieve? So we know that Qin will never again be able to march east  in conquest.
Duke <>Mu</> had forty sons. The heir apparent Ying succeeded him as ruler and is known as <>Duke  Kang</>. <>Duke Kang</> first year: in the previous  year,  when  Duke <>Mu</> died,  Duke <>Xiang</> of Jin also died. Duke <>Xiang</>'s younger brother  was named <>Yong</>  and, his mother being of the state of Qin, he was living in Qin. 

<>Zhao Dun</>, a high official of Jin, wanted to make him ruler of Jin and therefore dispatched Sui Hui to go to Qin to fetch him. The Qin armed forces had escorted <>Yong as</> far as <>Linghu</> when the people of Jin, having meanwhile set up Duke <>Xiang</>'s son as their new ruler, instead sent a force to attack the Qin army. The Qin army was defeated and Sui Hui fled back to Qin.

In  <>Duke Kang</>'s second year Qin attacked Jin and seized the city of Wu to retaliate  for  its defeat  at Linghu. In  <>Duke Kang</>'s fourth year Jin attacked Qin and seized Shaoliang. In his sixth year Qin attacked Jin and seized Jima, fighting at Hequ and inflicting a great defeat on the Jin army. The men of Jin, worried that <>Sui Hui</>, having gone over to Qin, would make trouble for Jin, sent <>Wei Shouyu</> to go to Qin and, pretending that he had turned against Jin, to plot with <>Sui Hui</>. By this ruse he was able to capture <>Sui Hui</> and take him back to Jin.

 <>Duke Kang</> died twelve years after assuming the  throne  and  was succeeded by his son,  <>Duke Gong</>.  In  <>Duke Gong</>'s second year, <>Zhao Chuan</> of Jin murdered his ruler, Duke <>Ling</>. In Duke  <>Gong</>'s  third  year,  King  <>Zhuang</> of Chu, being very powerful at this time, marched north with his troops as far as Luoyang and asked about the cauldrons of Zhou.

 <>Duke Gong</> died after five years of rule and was succeeded by his son, known as  <>Duke Huan</>. In  <>Duke Huan</>'s third year Jin defeated one of Qin's generals. In  <>Duke Huan</>'s tenth year King <>Zhuang</> of Chu conquered Zheng and advanced north to defeat the Jin forces at the Yellow River. At this time Chu, acting as overlord, called the other feudal rulers together to a conference to conclude an alliance.
