Duke <>Mu</> approved this plan and accordingly seated <>You Yu</>  on  a  mat  close by his side, pressed one dish after another  on him,  and  questioned  him about the topography of the Rong territory and the strength of  its  armed forces, till he had learned all about them. Then he ordered the internal secretary to send two sets of eight women musicians each to the Rong ruler. The Rong ruler accepted the musicians,  found  them  to  his  liking, and by year-end had still not sent them back. Qin then sent <>You Yu</> back to his own country.
