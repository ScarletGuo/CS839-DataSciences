"Then what should I do?" said <>Xiang Shou</>. "Wusui can never be given back to Hann in any case.". <>Su Dai</> replied, "Why don't you have Qin bring pressure on Chu to return the region of Yingchuan to Hann? Hann donated it to Chu in the first place. If you make the request and it is granted, that will show how much influence you exercise over Chu, and at the same time you will be doing Hann a favour in terms of territory. And if you make the request and it is not granted, then the enmity between Chu and Hann will remain unappeased and they will compete with one another for the friendship of Qin. Now that Qin and Chu are vying for power, you can afford to be somewhat critical of Chu and thereby bring Hann over to your side. This will be to Qin's advantage."
