In  <>Duke Kang</>'s second year Qin attacked Jin and seized the city of Wu to retaliate  for  its defeat  at Linghu. In  <>Duke Kang</>'s fourth year Jin attacked Qin and seized Shaoliang. In his sixth year Qin attacked Jin and seized Jima, fighting at Hequ and inflicting a great defeat on the Jin army. The men of Jin, worried that <>Sui Hui</>, having gone over to Qin, would make trouble for Jin, sent <>Wei Shouyu</> to go to Qin and, pretending that he had turned against Jin, to plot with <>Sui Hui</>. By this ruse he was able to capture <>Sui Hui</> and take him back to Jin.
