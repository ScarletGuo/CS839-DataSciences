The gentleman remarks: Duke <>Mu</> of Qin broadened his territory and increased his state, in the east humbling the powerful Jin, in  the  west making himself overlord of the Rong barbarians. But he never became a leader of the alliance, which is only right. For when he died, he cast aside  his people and instead enlisted his good ministers to  accompany  him  in death. When the kings of antiquity passed away, they left  virtue  behind  them and laws to be handed down. How could they ever snatch away their best men and good ministers, causing their people to grieve? So we know that Qin will never again be able to march east  in conquest.
